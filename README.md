# PocketPerceptron

This small tutorial provides code for the general Perceptron algorithm.

Specficially we analyze two cases here: One when the data is linearly seperable and one when it is not. We can see that when the data is not linearly seperable, Pocket Perceptron algorithm does much better than regular perceptron.
